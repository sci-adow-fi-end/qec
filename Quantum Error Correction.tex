\subsection{Foundations of quantum mechanics}

\subsubsection{Cinematic axioms}

\begin{enumerate}
    %TODO find a better s symbol
    \item To each quantum system S corresponds an Hilbert space $H_s$.\\
      The space of pure\footnote{The definition of pure state will
      be given in the section 4}
      states is identified by the projective space $P(H_s)$.

  \item Given two quantum systems $S_1$ and $S_2$ and their correspondent
    Hilbert spaces $H_{s1}$ and $H_{s2}$ the space that characterizes the
    compound system is $H_{s1} \otimes H_{s2}$, where $\otimes$ denotes
    the tensor product.

  \item A measure procedure on a quantum state S is described
    by a family \\  $M := \{M_\alpha \}_{\alpha\in A}$ where:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $M_\alpha \in B(H_s) $ $ \forall \alpha \in A$
        \item $A \subset \mathbb{R}$
        \item $\sum_{\alpha \in A} M_\alpha^\dag M_\alpha = Id(H_s)$
    \end{itemize}

    Where B(Hs) is the set of bounded operators in $H_s$ and A is the
    set of all the possible outcomes of the measure.\\
    Given the outcome $\alpha_0 \in A$ and the state $\ket{\psi}$,
    the probability
    of measuring the output $\alpha_0$ being in the state $\ket{\psi}$
    is: 
    \begin{center}
      $P(\psi : \alpha_0) = \braket{\psi|M_{\alpha_0}^\dag M_{\alpha_0}\psi}$
      
    \end{center}

    
\subsubsection{Dynamic axioms}


\item Given a quantum system $S_1$ and two time instants$ t_1$ and $t_2$
  with $t_1<=t_2$ there is an unique unitary operator$U(t_1,t_2)$ that
  describes the evolution of the system between the time instants.

  The unitary operator should respect also some additional
  properties:\\
    $
    \begin{cases}
        U(t_1,t_1) = Id(H_s)\\
        U(t_2,t_3)U(t_1,t_2) = U(t_1,t_3)
    \end{cases} $ 

  \item In the instant immediately after the measure
    $M := \{M_\alpha \}_{\alpha\in A}$ is applied to the quantum
    system S while being in the state $\ket{\psi}$ \\
    the system will collapse to the state:
    
    \begin{center}
      $\dfrac{M_{\alpha_0}\ket\psi}
      {\sqrt{\braket{\psi|M_{\alpha_0}^\dag M_{\alpha_0}\psi}}}$
    \end{center}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Qubits}

%FIXME unclear
The main reason we are interested in quantum systems in quantum
information science is because they can be used to store information.\\
Every physical system we can control can be used to store information
but not all systems are practical for doing so. \\
In fact, if we wanted to represent some complex information we
could have choosen to use a single complex system that has many states,
but doing so it would be very difficult to prepare it for the
computation.\\
Suppose for example that we had a way of quickly giving energy
to the system to make it jump from one of its base' states to
the next, and luckily we have it.\\
In the case of one single system to reach the n-Th base state
we would need n energy transfers, and that is quite unpractical.\\
Even more so if we consider than using multiple occurrences of
the simplest possible quantum system, that is the one that
has only 2 base states,\\ we would need at most $\log_2{n}$ transfers.\\
This simple quantum system is known as a qubit.\\

\section{One qubit systems}


\subsection{Introduction to quantum gates}
Quantum states are not very interesting when they are static, \\
what we want to achieve is a way to make them evolve\\
and accurately control their evolution over time.
The element used in a quantum system in order to make it evolve
in a controlled way is called a quantum gate.\\
While in classical information there is just a single kind of one bit
gate in quantum information there are infinitely many!
In the next paragraph we will se the most important ones.

\subsection{Some examples of one qubit gates}

\begin{itemize}

  %TODO insert matrix and definition of every port
\item
  Pauli Gates

\item
  Hadamard Gate
  
\item
  Phase Gates
  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{one qubit interference}

%TODO insert immage 

The reason why quantum algorithms can be faster than classical ones
in some tasks is because they can exploit some propreties of quantum
systems that classical systems lack.\\
One of these propreties is interference.\\
In quantum information interference is used to control the final
state of our system.\\
An example of this can be found in the circuit in Figure 1.
The circuit consists in two Hadamard gates with a phase gate
in between.\\
Below is the time analisys of the system.
\begin{itemize}

\item $\ket{\psi_{t0}} = \ket{0}$
\item $\ket{\psi_{t1}} = \dfrac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$
\item $\ket{\psi_{t2}} = \dfrac{\ket{0}+e^{\phi}\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$
\item $\ket{\psi_{t0}} = \ket{0}$
  
  
\end{itemize}


%TODO insert graph of measure

It is possible to observe that the output of the measure on the qubit
depends only on the ammout of fase shift that has been inflicted
to the qubit.



\subsection{introduction to quantum universality}

We have seen that our previous circuit allows us to manipulate a qubit
in every possible way but that leaves us with a practical question.
Is it possible to realize it in practice?
The short answer to this question is no, but we can get very close.
To elaborate more this answer we need to introduce a few definitions
regarding quantum universality.
\begin{itemize}

\item
  Strict universality
  %TODO insert definition

\item
  Prox universality
  %TODO insert definition

\end{itemize}

Unfortunately there isn't and can't be a finite set of strictly
universal
ports because of the fact that the space of unitary operators in a
Hilbert space is continue while the possible combinations of
operators we can get from a finite set of them is just countable.\\
The proprety we can actually achieve in a real world circuit is
prox-universality.\\

\begin{Prox-Universal-Set}
The set of gates {H,T,C-Not} is prox universal.
\end{Prox-Universal-Set}

Knowing it is possible to make a circuit that arbitrarly approximates
every
single quantum gate what we could be interested in discovering is how
big that circuit would be.\\

That is known thanks to an amazing result by Solovay and Kitaev which
states
that the number of ports we need to aproximate a circuit with a certain
precision grows logaritmically with the precision we want to achieve.
  
\begin{Solovay-Kitaev}

  Given a strictly universal set of gates S which is closed under inversion,
  the number of gates needed to approximate every n qubit circuit made
  from S whith precision $\epsilon$ is
  $O\Bigl(n2^n+2^nlog_2 \Bigl( \dfrac{1}{\epsilon}\Bigl)\Bigl)$
  

\end{Solovay-Kitaev}

\subsection{from system to subsystem}

When we study a quantum system we are not always interested in the
system
as a whole, sometimes we care only about a fraction of it.
Compartmentalizing the system if for sure easy and intuitive when it
is in a pure state, but can be more intricate when we are talking about
an entangled state.\\
In this latter case in fact we are not able to assign a state to the
subsystem that is independent from the rest of the original system
and we have to rely on the possibility of making statistical
predictions
about the outcomes of a measure on that subsystem.\\
To do it in a convenient way we use a special operator called density
operator.\\
It is very important in quantum computation because lets us describe
a not completely known ensamble of states.\\
Immagine for example we had a system that could be in each of the
states
$\ket{\psi_i}$ with probability $p_i$, we call $\{p_i,\ket{\psi_i}\}$ an
ensamble of pure states with an associate density operator
$\rho:=\sum_i p_i \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i} $


%TODO insert definition of density matrix.
